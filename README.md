# Portfolio Site

https://jnahc.github.io/portfolio-site-11-2019/

## Planning Materials
* https://trello.com/b/HKiFIkvo/self-portfolip
* https://www.figma.com/file/9IFUInabkGHxKfq75Lr2nQ/Portfolio-Site?node-id=0%3A1

## Brainstorming/Ideas
There were a few things that I saw on other project sites that I really liked. 
* Timeline concept
* Adding each technology as an icon
* Loading animation
 * Didn't get to this but I wanted to add something that's like the equivalent of a big metal gate opening up
* I wanted to keep it grayscale as much as possible, with a few pops of color

## Technologies Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript/jQuery
* Animista
* Bootstrap/Bootswatch Skin
* Text shadow, drop shadow, gradient generators

## If I had more time
* Adding in more personality
 * I have an animated version of myself that I want to get in here
 * Adding in mecha, Stargate references, or other sci fi/fantasy related icons

## Final remarks
I had alot of fun working on this portfolio site, there's a few things I will definitely be tweaking on this.
